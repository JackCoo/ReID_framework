<h1>Re-ID framework </h1>
<p>
 Person Re-ID framework in development during my PhD with the collaboration of Prof. Dr. William Robson Schwartz (UFMG).
 
 In this framework we have implemented the following works:

In order to reproduce the experiments you need to download the respective datasets:

VIPER (https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/node/178) - You need to include VIPER in a folder (.\datasets\viper\camX) where X is equal A or B for cameras A and B, respectively. 

PRID450S (http://lrs.icg.tugraz.at/download.php) - You need to include PRID450S in a folder (.\datasets\prid450s\camX) where X is equal A or B for cameras A and B, respectively.
