# ReID_framework
 Person Re-ID framework in development during my PhD with the collaboration of Prof. Dr. William Robson Schwartz (UFMG).
 
 In this framework we have implemented the following works:
 
1. Raphael Prates, William Robson Schwartz, “CBRA – Color-Based Ranking Aggregation for Person Re-Identification,” in IEEE ICIP, 2015.
 
2. Raphael Prates, William Robson Schwartz, “Appearance-Based Person Re-identification by Intra-Camera Discriminative Models and Rank Aggregation,” in International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), 2015.
 
3. Raphael Prates, Cristiane Dutra and William R. Schwartz, “PREDOMINANT COLOR NAME INDEXING STRUCTURE FOR PERSON RE-IDENTIFICATION,” in IEEE ICIP, 2016.
 
4. Raphael Prates, Marina Oliveira and William Robson Schwartz, “Kernel Partial Least Squares for Person Re-Identification,” in IEEE AVSS, 2016.
 
5. Raphael Prates and William Robson Schwartz, “Kernel Hierarchical PCA for Person Re-Identification,” in ICPR, 2016.
